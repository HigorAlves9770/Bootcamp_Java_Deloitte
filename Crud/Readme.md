Apply CRUD operations using Java

Reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

Work with ArrayList and user input via Scanner

Simulate a simple passenger management system

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8+)

ArrayList (in-memory data storage)

Scanner (console input)

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
